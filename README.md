# RESTEasy Spring Boot Starter

There was no RESTEasy Spring Boot starter out there, so PayPal team decided to create one and share it with the community.<br>

This Spring Boot starter is fully functional, has ZERO PayPal specific code on it, and can be used normally by any regular Spring Boot application that wants to have REST endpoints and prefers RESTEasy as the JAX-RS implementation.

Also, this RESTEasy Spring Boot starter integrates with Spring as expected, which means every JAX-RS REST resource that is also a Spring bean will be automatically auto-scanned, integrated, and available.

## Features
* Enable RESTEasy and Spring integration for Spring Boot applications
* Support Spring Boot application execution from `mvn spring-boot:run`
* Support JAX-RS providers, resources and sub-resources
* Support automatic discovery of [JAX-RS Application](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/ws/rs/core/Application.html) classes
* Support automatic discovery of JAX-RS providers and resources Spring beans 

## Usage
Just add the Maven dependency below to your Spring Boot application pom file.<br>

```
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.paypal.springboot</groupId>
	<artifactId>resteasy-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
	<version>2.0.2-SNAPSHOT</version>
	<scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```
